List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It typically consists of the following phases:
1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**  
   In this phase, stakeholders and developers collaborate to define the software's purpose, features, and functionality. Requirements are documented to ensure the final product meets user needs. For example, a team might create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
2. **Design**  
   Based on the requirements, the system architecture and design are planned. This includes creating technical specifications, data flow diagrams, and prototypes. Tools like UML (Unified Modeling Language) are often used to visualize the system's structure.
3. **Implementation (Coding)**  
   Developers write the actual code for the software based on the design specifications. This phase involves programming, unit testing, and integrating components. For instance, a team might use programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript to build the software.
4. **Testing**  
   The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs, ensure functionality, and validate performance. Testing methods include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Tools like Selenium or JUnit are commonly used.
5. **Deployment**  
   Once the software passes testing, it is deployed to the production environment for end-users. This may involve setting up servers, configuring databases, and ensuring smooth installation. For example, a web application might be deployed using cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
6. **Maintenance**  
   After deployment, the software is monitored and updated to fix issues, improve performance, and add new features. This phase ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time. For instance, regular updates to mobile apps like Instagram or WhatsApp are part of maintenance.
These phases ensure a systematic approach to software development, reducing risks and improving the quality of the final product.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
